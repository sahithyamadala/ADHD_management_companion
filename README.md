Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects focus, organization, and impulse control. Common symptoms include inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, which can impact daily life at school, work, and home. ADHD is often diagnosed in childhood but may persist into adulthood. Managing ADHD typically involves therapy, medication, and tools for better organization. This project aims to support individuals with ADHD by providing resources to enhance focus, manage tasks, and improve overall well-being.
